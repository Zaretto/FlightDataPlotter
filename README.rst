The purpose of Skeleton is to serve as an example of a basic Python package
including SetupTools capabilities, which will be migrated to Distribute in due
course.

README              - This file, which should really be ReST
LICENSE             - The license under which this package is released.
CHANGES             - An example change log document.
setup.py            - Template setup.py with lots of explanation. If you need a
                      setup.py use this as a starting point.
setup.cfg           - Additional configuration for setup.py, includes the all
                      import 'unittest' (used by Bitten) and 'nosetests' commands.
distribute_setup.py - The Distribute bootstrap script, leave it alone!
requirements.txt    - pip requirements file. Must include runtime and test suite
                      requirements. setup.py will parse this file.
MANIFEST.in         - Controls what files are put into the distribution source
                      file when you call 'python setup.py sdist'.

Ignore the cruft

By the way, now’s a good time to create an 'ignore' file for your revision
control system — you are using revision control, right? Since a bunch of this
stuff gets generated, we don’t want to check it into revision control.

See .bzrignore in this package for a auitable template.
