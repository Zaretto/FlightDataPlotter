You acknowledge that it is impractical for Flight Data Services to undertake
patent searches individually across all possible uses of the Product. 
Accordingly, Flight Data Services grants no warranty that the Product is non 
infringing in your jurisdiction or for your intended use, and you agree to
use the Product only in circumstances where you have satisfied yourself that
such use is non-infringing. 

For example, the case of PT Diagnostics, LLC v. Honeywell International Inc., 
et al., Case No. 2:10-cv-00493 references US patents that could be infringed
if this software was used to perform aircraft monitoring.
